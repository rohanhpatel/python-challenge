* Please run main.py from the directory it's in (either ./PyBank or ./PyPoll)

## PyBank

In PyBank, I go through each row and calculate the difference between the current profit/loss and previous profit/loss and use that number to update several values, and also update the total months and net profit/loss at each row. I then print the results after!

## PyPoll

In PyPoll, I go through each row and feed each vote into the dictionary. From there, I get the total votes and then calculate each of the percentages accordingly. Then, I print the results!
